\section{Abstract}

We implemented a two-player game in which players arrange a collection
of non-overlapping disks on a plane with the objective of minimizing
the size of their minimum enclosing circle.
The game can be played either between two humans or against the computer.

\section{Progress}

This phase of the project exhibits the ability to drag disks
using the mouse with collision detection, and compute the
minimal enclosing disk around them.

\section{Collision detection}

When a disk is being moved, we model the situation as a point
being moved among disks that are expanded by the radius of the
moving disk.
If the point intersects a single expanded disk, then we first
try to position the moving disk at the edge of the disk that
overlaps.
If that position overlaps some other disk, then the closest
position for the point is at an intersection of two expanded disks.
We simply choose the closest among all of the $O(n^2)$ intersection points.

\section{Minimal enclosing disk}

Given a fixed center point $c$, we calculate the minimum enclosing radius
as $\max \Big( \textrm{radius}(d) + \textrm{dist}(c, \textrm{center}(d)) \Big)$
over all disks $d$.

The optimal center point is approximated using a random walk.
For a fixed number of iterations, we generate a random vector,
and use it to shift the center if it results in an improvement.
